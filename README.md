## Summary
<b> 
The data started from 2010/12/1 and included 13 months of data.
The first month had the most customers and the best retention rate. 
It was December 2010, Christmas purchase demand and discounts brought new customers and in the following months, service kept them in online retail. 
Between 2011/1/1 and 2011/10/1, the number of new customers dwindled and had a rise between Sep. and Nov., then slumped in 2011 Dec on both cohorts and retention. Based on the data, online retail had a good start, but from the second month, it couldn't attract new users, the customer retention rate decreased. Online retail didn't catch the upward trend in Sep. It was adversely affected and lost 23% most loyaled customers.
